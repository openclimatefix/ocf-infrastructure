Two versions of OCF's Nowcasting Architecture Diagram can be found in this folder, with the latest/more granular one suffixed with "updated". 

The updated diagram with links to the code, logs etc can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cp-xZtkC3E6Lt-HbeFds_00iyQWqX0ii/view?usp=sharing) and can be opened with draw.io.
