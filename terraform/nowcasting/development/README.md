# Nowcasting (Development)

This folder specifies all relevant components to run this project on AWS.
All resources are specified in Terraform. By using Terraform anybody can run this script themselves.

## Setup

Install the terraform cli: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli. 
Initialize terraform by running `terraform init` in this directory.

## Configuration

The configuration options are specified in `variables.tf`.


## Infrastructure

There are several components to the system:

### ‚òÅÔ∏è NWP Consumer (ECS Task):
Gets the latest NWP data from the UK Met Office and saves the data to S3. This is run on ECS and is triggered by airflow. This is currently part of the `nowcasting` project. There are currently two different orders. 
- The first gets data for the next 12 hours with the following variables: `dlwrf`, `dswrf`, `hcc`, `lcc`, `mcc`, `prate`, `r`, `sde`, `si10`, `t`, `vis` .
- The second gets data for the next 42 hours with the following variables:  `dswrf` `lcc` `sde` `t` `wdir10`

### Other components:
- Databases: We have a few postgres database that store the PV and forecast data. These is run on RDS.
   - [Terraform](https://github.com/openclimatefix/ocf-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/modules/storage/postgres) 
- Site databases clean up: Once a day we run a service to remove any data that is more than ~3 days old. 
   - [Python Code](https://github.com/openclimatefix/pv-site-production/tree/main/database-cleanup)
   - [Terraform](https://github.com/openclimatefix/ocf-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/modules/services/database_clean_up) 
 and [Airflow Dag](https://github.com/openclimatefix/ocf-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/modules/services/airflow/dags/uk/forecast-site-dag.py#L49)
- Airflow is used to trigger the ECS tasks. They use the latest ECS Task definition. This is part of the [ocf airflow project](https://github.com/openclimatefix/ocf-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/airflow). 
- OCF Dashboard: This is use for internally looking at the forecasts. Also for managing `sites` and `users`. 


The forecast is trained offline and the model weights are saved to s3. [Python Code](https://github.com/openclimatefix/pv-site-prediction)
